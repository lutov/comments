# comments

Test task was to create component for comments/testimonials without frameworks. The reason for applying such condition may vary, that's why I choose not to build a large amount of helpers and have compiled only a simple demo. The best real solution for the task would probably be to use a framework, therefore the end result would be not much more then 1 model class, a simple controller and some frontend for the particular site.

Create database.php with your DB credentials in the /config folder if you want to run demo. Then run "composer install" to create autoload file.
